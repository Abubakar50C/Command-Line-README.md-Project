# Command-Line-README.md-Project

## DESCRIPTION 
- This is a node.js application that operates in the command line. In this project, is some javascript which when "node index.js" is called, will use an inquirer package 
  to prompt user with a series of question. Based on the answers, a high quality, personal README.md file will be created for the user.

- My motivation with this project is to truly see how node.js and the command line work together in order to produce html or an entire webpage.

- I built this project because I've been learning about node.js and the command line, but I've been wondering how this would play into a webpage that user might be using.
  This project is in a way answering those concerns I had, and also giving me some more practice with the topic.

- This project solves the problem of a user possibly not knowing how to create a high quality README.md file or not having the appropriate software to. There are a lot of things
  that may make it difficult for a user to create a nice README.md file, and this project will solve that.
